Example from http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/guessing-game.html

To build: `cargo build` in this directory.
To run, `cargo run`. This will also do a build if the sources have changed.

The file `Cargo.toml` is the build definition.
The `Cargo.lock` file is a shrink-wrap of the versions and sources used in the package.
